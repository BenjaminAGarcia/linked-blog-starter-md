# Definition:
A function F(x) is a primitive of a function f (x) on an interval if F is differentiable on the interval and satisfies the equation $F^{\prime}(x)=f(x).$
 - **Example:The function F(x) = arctan x is a primitive of f (x) =$\frac{1}{1+x^2}$ on the entire real line.**
## Proposition 1 :
If F1(x) and F2(x) are two primitives of f (x) on the same interval, then the difference F1(x) − F2(x)is constant on that interval, because of the subtraction of these two functions is a constant number which has its derivative as zero.

To **set** the primitive function, the operation of finding a primitive has the name “indefinite integration” and the mathematical notation $\int f(x)dx$,  called the indefinite integral of f (x) on the given interval. 

So we have
$$d \int F(x)dx = dF(x) = F^{\prime}(x)dx = f(x)dx.$$

So we can prove some
## Basic General Methods of Finding Primitives

We have some methods of four operations and complex formula, and we should introduce
### Divisional Integral Formula (of integration by parts)
$$\int u(x)dv(x) = u(x)v(x)-\int v(x)du(x) + C.$$
We will note some more methods.
$\int x^{\alpha}dx=\frac1{\alpha+1}x^{\alpha+1}+c.$
$\int \frac1x dx=ln|x|+c.$
$\int a^{x} dx = \frac1{lna}a^{x}+c.$
$\int cos \ x \ dx = sin x +c.$
$\int sin \ x \ dx = -cos x +c.$
$\int \frac1{sin^{2}x} \ x \ dx = -cot x +c.$
$\int \frac1{cos^{2}x} \ x \ dx = tan x +c.$

To sum up, what if we could combine it with
