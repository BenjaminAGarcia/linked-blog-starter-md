# Definition:

We have studied the algebraic extension and the geometric interpretation of the field of complex numbers before.As well as the polar forms.

The complex number can be represented in the form
$z = r(\sin{\phi}+i\sin{\phi})$, in which r is the **modulus** and the φ is the **argument**.

The really new contents are:
### Convergence of C Series
Since it is clear from the inequalities
$\max{|x_{n}-x_{0}|,|y_{n}-y_{0}|,} \leq |z_{n}-z_{0}| \leq |x_{n}-x_{0}|+|y_{n}-y_{0}|$,
we could set the convergence of a series with complex terms, thus following the [[Theorem--Cauchy Criterion]].
If each sequence reaches its absolute value and are still convergent, the sequence is **absolutely convergent**.

Set a series converges absolutely for every element. in that case the general term does not tend to zero. Series of this form are called **power series**:
$c_{0} + c_1(z − z_0) +···+ c_n(z − z_0)^ n +···$

So we have **Cauchy-Hadamard** Formula, which indicates that
